# JCoRe Pipelines

These are pre-built pipelines for various NLP aspects.

### Objective


### Requirements & Dependencies
In order to use these pipelines you need at least [JDK 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)(Java SE Development Kit 7), [UIMA 2.6](https://uima.apache.org/index.html) & [Maven 3.0](https://maven.apache.org/). We also recommend using [Eclipse IDE for Java Developers](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) as your Java IDE if you're planning on using/building the pipelines programmatically(?) with Java, since it comes with the Maven Plugin. However, you're free to try it with different versions than those mentioned, but we can't make promises for a flawless functioning of our components in these cases.
